### What is this?
android_contacs_plugin is a package for flutter that allows you to read contacts from your phone  
(only on Android !!!)

  
### Stack:
Languages - Dart, Kotlin
  
### A few words:
During development,  
I used the kotlin plugin (https://github.com/vestrel00/contacts-android)  
to get contacts from the android platform and sent data to flutter via method channel.

This package helped me to better understand flutter's interaction with OS via method channel.
